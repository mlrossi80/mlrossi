			<p>I am interested in the overlap of creative and artistic pursuits with citizen science, engineering, entrepreneurship, and collaborative pedagogies. My work combines writing and arts projects with scientific observation, maker culture, and entrepreneurship toward the end of building new tools for creative expression and new methods for teaching and understanding the full breadth of the act of writing.</p>
					
			<p><strong>Multimodality and Maker Spaces</strong></p>
			<p>Much of my work as a writer and much of my research as an academic is focused on multimodal writing habits. As a writer I work on projects that invite visuality and motion into them. As an academic, I teach students to think of activities like drawing, coding, and building new things as valid forms of writing. As a consultant in the Columbia University Writing Center, I pushed for an ethos of multiliteracy, leading workshops on using doodles to help writers. In my first year writing classes at MSU, I teach my class to look toward acts of making and design as part of their process in writing.</p>

			<p><strong>The Hateful Beast of the North Sea</strong></p>
			<p>As someone who loves to see visual arts and literature overlap, it is no surprise that I am drawn to comics as a form. I am currently working on a script for a limited run series (in need of an illustrator) titled Infinite City. Earlier this year, I also worked as a script editor for an upcoming comic/musical theater piece called The Hateful Beast of the North Sea. Developed by <a href="http://www.squibn.com/squibn" target="_blank">Squibn Studios</a>, The Hateful Beast will be a bright and beautiful celebration of visual, literary, and musical art.</p>

			<p><strong>Microcosmos Blog</strong></p>
			<p>I am a super user and a regular contributor to a website dedicated to ordinary citizens engaging in scientific observation using origami microscopes called Foldscopes. I found my way to this when I made a microscope of my own from e-waste and began taking photos with it. My essays (<a href="https://microcosmos.foldscope.com/?author=739" target="_blank">linked here</a>) focus on the overlap of human spaces and the microscopic world, as well as the aesthetics and art of scientific seeing.</p>

			<p><strong>Museum of Urban Naturalism</strong></p>
			<P>Through my observations with my microscope, I have also begun building an itinerant museum of natural history dedicated to looking at human spaces and natural spaces through artful images of microscopic creatures. By decentralizing the concept of the museum, the project will allow the museum's collection to become a flexible act of performace, of installation art, and a broader commentary on the interconnectedness of natural and human spaces. Currently the museumâ€™s collection is housed in my <a href="https://vimeo.com/user43521015" target="_blank">Vimeo feed</a>, but a more fully developed website is coming.</p>
			
			<p><strong>Sharp and Weird</strong></p>
			<p>I am one half of a collaborative creative enterprise called Sharp and Weird. We are dedicated to building digital projects that blend genres of art, literature, and pedagogy. Our current project is a game called Egg Hunt, which will use the form of a classic text adventure game to tell a story via text messenger.</p>

			<p><strong>One Month</strong></p>
			<p>Last year, I was a content creator and online editor for the Learning Library of One Month, an online school that teaches coding for business in one month. Like many startups, their ethos is one of creativity, experimentation, and process thinking. While working for them, I wrote several blog posts. My favorites were those that focused on <a href="http://learn.onemonth.com/the-best-text-editors-for-beginners" target="_blank">learning to code as a novice</a>, <a href="http://learn.onemonth.com/doodlers-day-how-to-make-great-infographics-on-the-fly" target="_blank">multimodal thinking</a>, and <a href="http://learn.onemonth.com/why-i-built-a-microscope-instead-of-writing-my-book" target="_blank">creativity as a learning strategy</a>.</p>
			<p>Earlier in the year, my Sharp and Weird collaborator and I were hired as pedagogical consultants to beta test a class. They later asked us to meet with them to brainstorm ways to develop their online courses into something more closely resembling a school. Our technique in working as business consultants is to use writing center techniques to lead entrepreneurs toward their best ideas without imposing our own wills on them.</p>

			<p><strong>House of Genius</strong></p>
			<p>In spring 2016, through the work I did with One Month, I was invited to participate as a panelist for an event called <a href="http://houseofgenius.org/about-genius/" target="_blank">House of Genius</a>. This is a monthly forum in which entrepreneurs present problems in their businesses to a room of anonymous advisers. The idea is that the ideas are received in their purest form, rather than being biased by perceived expertise. The event allows people to develop their business ideas and take their business through the next hurdle of its development while also networking based on interesting thoughts, rather than perceived status.</p>
